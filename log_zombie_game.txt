In the project I have created a textureholder 
"A singleton is a design pattern, a way to structure our code that is proven to work"
this is according to john horton to avoid us having to worry about running out of memory, but why? 

"main.h:4:1: error: ‘Zombie’ does not name a type " this error was caused because i had not declared the class Zombie in the start of the document.

The game now starts but is frozen. Why ? Missplacement of a bracket maybe. - turns out i forgot an event (keyPressed {} ) 

The is a bug the zombies will only chase when player x y is
